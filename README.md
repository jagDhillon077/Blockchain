# Blockchain Project
### Written in JavaScript

## Project Overview

This project was created to explore and understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology while also gaining experience with JavaScript. Blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is a decentralized ledger that ensures data integrity and transparency across a network of computers. By working on this project, the goal is to learn more about how blockchains work and how they can be implemented in code using JavaScript.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

- **Learn blockchain technology**: Understand the core concepts, such as blocks, chains, mining, and consensus mechanisms.
- **Explore JavaScript**: Use JavaScript as the primary language for implementing blockchain logic, gaining familiarity with its syntax and features.
- **Implement a simple blockchain**: Create a basic blockchain model that includes functionalities such as adding blocks, validating the chain, and simulating the mining process.

## Files in This Project

The project folder contains the following key files:

- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and instructions on how to use it.
- **blockChain.js**: The main JavaScript file where the blockchain logic is implemented. This includes the structure of blocks, the blockchain class, and methods for adding new blocks, validating the chain, and more.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including its name, version, and dependencies. It also includes scripts that can be used to run the project.
- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that ensures consistent dependency versions across different environments.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js installed. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.
   
2. **Run the Project**: Use `node blockChain.js` to execute the blockchain implementation and see it in action.

3. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the `blockChain.js` file to explore different aspects of blockchain technology and test your understanding.
