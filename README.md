### Written in JavaScript

 A blockchain collects information together in groups, these groups are also known as blocks. The blocks contain certain information depending on the usage. These blocks are individual records linked together in a single list, and are used for recording transactions made by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC)

 The point of a blockchain is to have a decentralized network of all transactions across a network of peers. Because of this decentralization, there is no need for a central clearing authority (Banks, Governments, Middleman)
